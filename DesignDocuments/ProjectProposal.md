# What We are Building
* We are building an app that helps users discover and manage a collection of online influencers across social platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. Rather than using a live API, we are simulating influencer data using a local dataset that mimics API responses. Users will be able to search and filter influencers based on platform, content category, follower count, and country. They can then build a personalized favorites list and export it as a .csv or .json file. The system is designed to help users explore and track influencers theyâ€™re interested in, while demonstrating full-featured search and data management functionality.
